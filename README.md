# 🥗 Meal Planning Algorithm

This repository visualizes and explains my **Meal Planning Algorithm**, which uses system thinking and logic loops to plan a full week of meals.

### 🔁 Weekly Loop (Day 1 to 7)
- Collect user inputs (budget, restrictions, preferences)
- Plan meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner
- Adjust for time, variety, and budget
- Output weekly summary + shopping list

---

## 💻 Purpose
This project demonstrates **algorithmic thinking**:
- Translating flowcharts into **Python-like pseudocode**
- Understanding **loops**, **conditions**, and **data updates**
- Building foundations for **AI or app-based meal planners**

## 🧩 Next Steps
- [ ] Add `main.py` to automate the weekly planning logic
- [ ] Create a budget-tracking function
- [ ] Export results to CSV or Google Sheets
