# 🥗 Meal Planning Algorithm

This repository visualizes and explains my **Meal Planning Algorithm**, which uses system thinking and logic loops to plan a full week of meals.

## 📊 Flowchart
![Meal Planning Algorithm Flowchart](./Miguel_Beltran_W0D4_%20Algorithm%20Design%20&%20Flowcharts.jpg)

### 🔁 Weekly Loop (Day 1 to 7)
- Collect user inputs (budget, restrictions, preferences)
- Plan meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner
- Adjust for time, variety, and budget
- Output weekly summary + shopping list

---

## 💻 Purpose
This project demonstrates **algorithmic thinking**:
- Translating flowcharts into **Python-like pseudocode**
- Understanding **loops**, **conditions**, and **data updates**
- Building foundations for **AI or app-based meal planners**

## 🧠 About This Project

This project was created to visualize the logic behind a Meal Planning Algorithm that uses system thinking and loops to plan a full week of meals. The goal is to demonstrate how decision-making (like budget, time, and dietary restrictions) can be structured logically and later implemented in code.

---
## ⚙️ How It Works

The algorithm follows a weekly loop (Day 1–7) that:

Collects user inputs (budget, dietary restrictions, and preferences)

Checks conditions (busy day, time available, budget remaining)

Selects appropriate meals (quick or regular)

Updates the budget and adds the meal to the weekly list

Outputs a final shopping list and weekly summary

This structure can later be translated directly into code (e.g., Python) using loops (for day in range(1,8)), functions (update_budget()), and conditionals (if busy:).

---
## 🔄 Future Directions

Automate the loop in Python (main.py)

Integrate a budget-feedback mechanism

Extend the framework toward modeling resource allocation or decision-making inequality

## 🔎 Research Context

This project serves as a prototype for modeling how algorithmic systems shape individual decision-making, a key theme in my sociological research on surveillance, technology, and social control.
